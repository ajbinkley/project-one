Title: Influence of Variables on Flight Pricing

Team Members: Andy Binkley, Adam DeBruler, Annie Diaz, Samia Paramore, Tiffany Wan Yeung

Project Description / Outline: Goal is to determine how 5 known variables are expected to influence the price of airline tickets across the country.
The 5 variables are:
  Distance
  Day of week
  How far in advance (timing of purchase)
  Layovers
  Time of day
  
Research questions to answer: Of 5 known variables that affect airline price, which ones have the most/least amount of influence on airline ticket prices?

Data sets to be used: Travelpayouts.com, maybe an airline price aggregator (TBD pending site scrapability), Airport code CSV file (Github),

Rough breakdown of tasks:

Each member of the group will be assigned a variable to pull data on and create a visual that represents the correlation of its impact on airline price. 

Distance: (Andy)
Day of Week: (Samia)
Timing of purchase: (Tiffany)
Layovers: (Adam)
Time of Day: (Annie)
