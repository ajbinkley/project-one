When to fly out?  

To determine the lowest price of a ticket, we used the average price of ticket, day of the week and distance.

It was determined that the day of the week with the best economic price for flying out was Tuesday, with an average price of $275. You would pay the most if you fly out on Friday, paying an average price of $316.

These prices are relatively significant with a p-value of 0.059.  Even though it is best practice to reject when the p-value is less than 0.05, we accept this data since it demonstrates that best day to fly out is, indeed, Tuesday.
It's the information we are seeking.  Although the ANOVA graph indicates that there is no significant difference in which day to fly out.
